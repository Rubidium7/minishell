add //debug to lines that need to be removed for eval
tree syntax checking seems to function, haven't fixed the leaks yet tho
report found syntax bugs to notes
putting something like '(cmd1 | cmd2 || cmd3) && cmd4 || cmd5' doesn't work correctly in the tree formation..
cmd1(cmd2 && cmd3) && cmd4) does not behave correctly
above syntax error bugs fixed
still need to make sure that redir syntax errors don't the precedence over others
echo hi > "$<NON_EXISTENT>" does not produce correct error
echo hi > ""$<NON_EXISTENT> has a double free....
fix no command found return val
echo crashes without arguments :D
